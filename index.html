        <p>
            Hi, I'm Vaishnavi Nagu! I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have gained valuable professional 
            experience during my two years at Infosys. Driven by my passion for learning and growth, I decided to pursue 
            my Master's degree in the United States to enhance my skills further. As a small-town girl with big dreams, I 
            strive to turn my aspirations into reality through hard work and determination.
